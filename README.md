### Purpose
For several years now utilities have been using "smart meters" to optimize their residential meter reading infrastructure. Smart meters continuously transmit consumption information in the 900MHz ISM band allowing utilities to simply send readers driving through neighborhoods to collect commodity consumption information. The protocol used to transmit these messages is fairly straight forward, however I have yet to find any reasonably priced product for receiving these messages.

This project is a proof of concept software defined radio receiver for these messages. We make use of an inexpensive rtl-sdr dongle to allow users to non-invasively record and analyze the commodity consumption of their household.

Currently the only known supported and tested meter is the Itron C1SR. However, the protocol is designed to be useful for several different commodities and should be capable of receiving messages from any ERT capable smart meter.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bemasher/rtlamr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bemasher/rtlamr)

### Requirements
 * GoLang >=1.2 (Go build environment setup guide: http://golang.org/doc/code.html)
 * GCC (on windows TDM-GCCx64 works nicely)
 * libfftw >=3.3
   * Windows: [pre-built binaries](http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html)
   * Linux (debian): [package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/libfftw3-dev)
 * rtl-sdr
   * Windows: [pre-built binaries](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/attachment/wiki/rtl-sdr/RelWithDebInfo.zip)
   * Linux: [source and build instructions](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

### Building
This project requires two other packages I've written for SDR related things in Go. The package [`github.com/bemasher/rtltcp`](http://godoc.org/github.com/bemasher/rtltcp) provides a means of controlling and sampling from rtl-sdr dongles. This package will be automatically downloaded and installed when getting rtlamr.

The second package needed is [`github.com/bemasher/fftw`](http://godoc.org/github.com/bemasher/fftw), which may require more effort to build. Assuming for linux you already have the necessary library, no extra work should need to be done. For windows a library file will need to be generated from the dll and def files for gcc. The FFTW defs and dlls can be found here: http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

#### On Windows

	go get -d github.com/bemasher/fftw
	dlltool -d libfftw3-3.def -D libfftw3-3.dll -l $GOPATH/src/github.com/bemasher/fftw/libfftw3.a
	go get github.com/bemasher/rtlamr

#### On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
	
	sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
	go get github.com/bemasher/rtlamr

This will produce the binary `$GOPATH/bin/rtlamr`. For convenience it's common to add `$GOPATH/bin` to the path.

### Usage
Available command-line flags are as follows:

```bash
$ rtlamr -h
Usage of rtlamr:
	-centerfreq=920299072: center frequency to receive on
	-duration=0: time to run for, 0 for infinite
	-filterid=0: display only messages matching given id
	-format="plain": format to write log messages in: plain, json, xml or gob
	-gobunsafe=false: allow gob output to stdout
	-logfile="/dev/stdout": log statement dump file
	-quiet=false: suppress state information printed at startup
	-samplefile="NUL": received message signal dump file, offset and message length are displayed to log when enabled
	-server="127.0.0.1:1234": address or hostname of rtl_tcp instance
	-single=false: provides one shot execution, listens until exactly one message is recieved
```

Note that for both json and xml output, there is no root element. Instead each line is one element.

Running the receiver is as simple as starting an `rtl_tcp` instance and then starting the receiver:

```bash
# Terminal A
$ rtl_tcp

# Terminal B
$ rtlamr
```

If you want to run the spectrum server on a different machine than the receiver you'll want to specify an address to listen on that is accessible from the machine `rtlamr` will run on with the `-a` option for `rtl_tcp`.

Using a NooElec NESDR Nano R820T with the provided antenna, I can reliably receive standard consumption messages from ~250 different meters and intermittently from another 400 meters. These figures are calculated from messages received during a 25 minute window where the preamble had no bit errors and no errors were detected or corrected using the checksum. Reliably in this case means receiving at least 10 of the expected 12 messages and intermittently means 3-9 messages.

### Example

Example output is as follows, note that the meter ID's and checksums have been obscured to avoid releasing potentially sensitive information:

Below is a photo of the face of the meter I've been testing with along with sample output received from the meter. The messages below are all from the same meter. You can see on the face of the meter the commodity type, in this case electricity is `07` and the meter ID is `17581###` with the last 3 digits censored. The meter displays the current consumption value in kWh's and transmits hundredths of a kWh.

If you have any general questions or feedback leave a comment below. For bugs, feature suggestions and anything directly relating to the program itself, submit an issue in github.

### Future

 * There's still a decent amount of house-keeping that needs to be done to clean up the code for both readability and performance.
 * Move away from dependence on FFTW. While FFTW is a great library integration with Go is messy and it's absence would greatly simplify the build process.
 * Implement direct error correction rather than brute-force method.
 * Finish tools for discovery and usage of hopping pattern for a particular meter. There's enough material in this alone for another writeup.
 * Implement adaptive preamble quality thresholding to improve false positive rejection.
